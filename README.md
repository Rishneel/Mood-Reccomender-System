— A recommender system is designed to suit the user’s preference, but very few platforms consider the user’s mood status when recommending a title. Human behavior is very versatile at most and hard to predict, thus this research paper observes how a Mood-based Movie recommender system tries to find a middle ground between the identified gap which is the mood to allow users to get more accurate movies. Many platforms are capable of recommending movies efficiently but there is an uncertainty that the users do not find the recommender systems to be efficient enough from a user’s perspective in terms of recommendations preferred by them. The concept of mood in the research focuses on implementing machine learning algorithms to try and combat the issues the users face. The users are presented with a GUI to select up to three moods to get the results suited for their particular moods. Thus our research reflects a prominence on the Mood-based aspect of the Movie Recommender system.
